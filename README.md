## Code Challenges - Design patterns
- DIO + TQI Bootcamp - Kotlin


These challenges were designed for me, as a student, to modify and create lines to transform the provided code into a design pattern.<br>
[01 - Singleton](https://github.com/oNeitan/code-patterns-challenges-dio/tree/main#:~:text=1%20hour%20ago-,03.%20Adapter.kt,-upload%3A%20adapter%20code)<br>
[02 - Builder](https://github.com/oNeitan/code-patterns-challenges-dio/blob/main/02.%20Builder.kt)<br>
[03 - Adapter](https://github.com/oNeitan/code-patterns-challenges-dio/blob/main/03.%20Adapter.kt)<br>

The following archives are codes with a more specific aplication, as Koltin functionalities and more advanced code execution.<br>
[04 - Extension functions](https://github.com/oNeitan/code-patterns-challenges-dio/blob/main/04.%20Extension%20functions.kt)<br>
[05 - Asynchronous processing](https://github.com/oNeitan/code-patterns-challenges-dio/blob/main/05.%20Asynchronous%20processing.kt)
